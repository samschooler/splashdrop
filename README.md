# SplashDrop

[SplashDrop](https://splashdrop.sam.ink) is a hobby project built in order to always have fresh desktop backgrounds. I used the Unsplash API and the Dropbox API in order to download/upload amazing public domain photos to my dropbox. This enables me to [configure my computer](https://sam.ink/projects/splashdrop/#setup) to update its background photos everyday.

__Note: This repository was used by me personally, and the code may not be up to a standard I would like, but I wanted to share it regardless.__

## Setting Your Desktop Wallpaper to SplashDrop
In order to have a set of desktop wallpapers that update everyday, you must first [Authorize SplashDrop to access your Dropbox](https://splashdrop.com/authorize) via the SplashDrop website. Then, make sure to install the dropbox client on your computer.  
Then go to __System Preferences -> Desktops & Screensavers__.  

Click on the "+" in the bottom left corner.  

Navigate to __your Dropbox folder/Apps/SplashDrop__.  

Click "Choose".  

Check the box at the bottom of the window next to "Change picture:"  

Change the period to "Ever day"  

You are done! You now will have new wallpapers on all of your screens everyday!
